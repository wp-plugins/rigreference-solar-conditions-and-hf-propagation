The widget displays Solar and HF-propagation conditions based on NOAA data.

== Description ==

Solar conditions play a crucial role in HF-propagation conditions. RigReference.com has a widget showing the current conditions based on NOAA data. This data can be used by ham radio operators to determine the best time to make long-range communications on shortwave bands (160 to 10 meters). 
But this widget required you to edit your templates and add a little javascript snippet to them.

With this WordPress widget you can now add the solar widget to your blog easy and simple.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rigref-solar-widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is HF-propagation? =

HF-propagation is the way in which radio waves travel through the earth's atmosphere. Many different factors influence propagation; time of day, temperature, weather and solar activity.

= On what data is the widget based? =

The widget is based on solar-terrestrial data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They have a wealth of information available for anyone interested. Among others, they measure solar activity and make it available - as raw text - here: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/latest/
